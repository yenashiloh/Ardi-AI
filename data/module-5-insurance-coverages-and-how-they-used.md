#  Insurance Coverages and How They Are Used

## Coverage Terminologies

### 1. Bodily Injury Liability/Policy Limits (PL)
- If you are responsible for a car accident, bodily injury liability coverage pays for the medical costs of the people who are injured (not including yourself).

### 2. Uninsured Motorist (UM)
- A coverage that helps you pay for damages caused by a driver who doesn't have car insurance.

### 3. Underinsured Motorist (UIM)
- A coverage that protects you if you're hit by a driver who doesn't have enough coverage to pay for the damages or injuries they caused.

### 4. Medical Payments (MedPay)
- Is an additional coverage option for auto insurance policies in most states. In the event of a car accident, this coverage can help pay for medical expenses for you or your passengers, even if you're at fault.

### 5. Collision Coverage
- A coverage that helps pay to repair or replace your vehicle if it's damaged or destroyed in an accident with another car, regardless of who is at fault.

### 6. Comprehensive
- Covers any damage to a car except for damage from a collision.

### 7. Umbrella Policy
- If you face a lawsuit due to a personal injury claim, and the damages awarded exceed the limits of your primary insurance policy, your umbrella policy comes into play. It provides additional coverage on top of your primary policy's limits, extending your liability protection. Umbrella policies typically offer coverage in increments of $1 million or more.

### 8. Personal Injury Protection (PIP)
- A type of car insurance coverage that helps pay for medical expenses, lost wages, and other related costs if you or your passengers are injured in a car accident, regardless of who is at fault. PIP is also known as "no-fault" insurance.

### Bodily Injury / Policy Limits (PL) Coverage:

**Example 1:** If one person is injured in an accident covered by a bodily injury policy of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident:
- **Bodily Injury/Policy Limits:** $50,000 per person / $100,000 per accident
- **Coverage:** Up to $50,000 for one injured person.
- **Total Pot Money:** $50,000.

**Example 2:** If two persons are injured in an accident covered by the same policy:
- **Coverage:** Up to $50,000 per person.
- **Total Pot Money:** $100,000.

**Example 3:** If five people are injured in an accident covered by the same policy:
- **Coverage:** Up to $100,000 total.
- **Total Pot Money:** $100,000.

### Uninsured Motorist (UM) Coverage:

**Example 1:** If one person is injured in an accident where the at-fault party doesn't have insurance, but the injured party/plaintiff is covered by an uninsured motorist policy of $17,500 per person and $35,000 per accident:
- **Uninsured Motorist (UM) Coverage:** $17,500 per person / $35,000 per accident
- **Coverage:** Up to $17,500 for one injured person.
- **Total Pot Money:** $17,500.

**Example 2:** If five people are injured in an accident covered by the same policy:
- **Coverage:** Up to $35,000 total.
- **Total Pot Money:** $35,000.

**Example 3:** If two people are injured, one driver and one passenger, covered by the same policy, but the passenger also has their own UM coverage from their own auto insurance with the same amount in the policy:
- **Driver:** $17,500.
- **Passenger:** $17,500 from the driver's UM coverage + $17,500 from the passenger's own UM coverage.
- **Total Pot Money:** $52,500.

### Underinsured Motorist (UIM) Coverage:

#### Rules on applying UIM Coverage in California:
1. Underinsured Motorist Coverage only applies if the injured party's UIM coverage is higher than the at-fault party/defendant's policy limit coverage.
2. We must exhaust the defendant's policy limits to use our client's UIM coverage.
3. We can only claim the remaining policy coverage after deducting our client's UIM coverage from the defendant's policy limits.

**Example 1:** UIM coverage of $17,500 per person / $35,000 per accident and a policy limit of $20,000 per person / $40,000 per accident:
- **Defendant's PL:** $20,000 / $40,000.
- **Client's UIM:** $17,500 / $35,000.
- **Total Pot Money:** $20,000 (since the defendant's policy limit is higher than the client's UIM policy).

**Example 2:** UIM coverage of $20,000 per person / $40,000 per accident and a policy limit of $17,500 per person / $35,000 per accident:
- **Client's UIM:** $20,000 / $40,000.
- **Defendant's PL:** $17,500 / $35,000.
- **Total Pot Money:** $17,500 from the defendant's PL + $2,500 from the client's UIM coverage = $20,000.

#### Nevada & Texas Exception:
- In Nevada, there is no requirement for the client's UIM coverage to exceed the defendant's policy limits, nor is it necessary to deplete the defendant's policy limits.

**Example:** Client's UIM of $20,000 per person / $40,000 per accident and the defendant's policy limits of $17,500 per person / $35,000 per accident:
- **Total Pot Money:** $37,500.
