## What is Personal Injury?

When an accident happens, victims don’t immediately settle with the liable party. They look for an attorney to help them get better compensation for the injuries, mentally and physically.

**Personal Injury**: An area of law that protects individuals from injury that results from another person or party’s negligence, malpractice, or any act of wrongdoing.

## Elements of Negligence in a Personal Injury Case

1. **Duty of Care**: The defendant had a legal responsibility to act in a way that would prevent foreseeable harm to the plaintiff.
2. **Breach of Duty**: The defendant failed to uphold their duty of care by acting or failing to act in a manner that a reasonable person would in similar circumstances.
3. **Causation**: The defendant's breach of duty directly caused the plaintiff's injuries.
4. **Damages**: This refers to the actual harm or losses suffered by the injured person (the plaintiff) as a direct result of the defendant's negligence.

## Statute of Limitations (SOL)

The Statute of Limitations refers to the legal time limit within which a person can bring a lawsuit or file a legal claim. Once this time period expires, the claim is typically barred, meaning the person can no longer pursue legal action for that particular issue.

A law that sets the maximum amount of time those parties in a dispute have to initiate legal proceedings. The length of time allowed under a statute of limitations varies depending upon the type of Personal Injury Case.
