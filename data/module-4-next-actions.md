## Confirm Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist

1. In car accident cases, clients will often have what is called UM/UIM coverage through their own insurance company. This will provide the client coverage for their medical bills and pain and suffering if the Defendant does not have insurance or not enough insurance to cover the client’s damages.
2. Client’s Dec Page will show us exactly the types of coverage a client has including UM/UIM limits.
3. It is important to check if the date of the incident falls within the policy period stated on Declarations Page. Cause if not, then the client is considered a Prop213.

## Prop 212

In an auto accident, Prop 213 prevents drivers, injured in a car accident, from obtaining non-economic damages (e.g. pain and suffering) even when the accident was not their fault if they lack car insurance or the car they were driving was not covered by insurance.

## REMEMBER Prop 213 does not apply: 

1. To passengers 
2. To a parked vehicle 
3. If the Defendant was considered DUI (driving under influence)

## Uninsured Motorist 

UM coverage helps the client pay for damages caused by a negligent driver who doesn't have a valid auto insurance coverage.

## Underinsured Motorist

UIM coverage, on the other hand, steps in when an at-fault driver has liability limits that are too low to cover the medical expenses of the client.

## Policy Limits (PL) Search or Insurance Search on the Defendant

1. PL is the liability coverage of the at-fault driver. It is the highest amount the other party will pay for a claim.
2. More often than not, we want to know the defendant’s insurance policy limits in order to work up a case. We need to prevent situations where the client accumulates huge medical bills on a case when there is only a little amount of insurance limits we can recover.

## Ways to locate Defendant’s Insurance 

1. **Phishing Letter to Defendant**
      - This is a letter we send directly to the at-fault driver, asking for his insurance information.  
      - This is a friendly letter rather than a threat, since most defendants get scared easily when receiving a letter from an attorney’s office. 
     - This letter has a language stating that the firm is not going against him but through his insurance. As part of the premium he’s paying, his insurance has the obligation to protect him on incidents like auto collisions. 
2. **Insurance Request Through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**
      - This is a letter we send directly to the at-fault driver, asking for his insurance information.  
     - This is a friendly letter rather than a threat, since most defendants get scared easily when receiving a letter from an attorney’s office. 
     - This letter has a language stating that the firm is not going against him but through his insurance. As part of the premium he’s paying, his insurance has the obligation to protect him on incidents like auto collisions. 
3. **Insurance Search Through Online Portals**

    - This letter has a language stating that the firm is not going against him but through his insurance. As part of the premium he’s paying, his insurance has the obligation to protect him on incidents like auto collisions. 

## Request Medical Records (MR) and Billing Records (BR) 

- If a client went to a hospital (ER) or was transported by an ambulance, Medical Records & Billing records should be requested from the providers after confirming that there is an available UM/UIM coverage. 
 - All these are being requested separately even if the client just went to one hospital.

1. Locate and call the medical provide
    - Ask for the medical records department/release of information 
2. Provide the following information to the representative
