We pride ourselves on our attention to detail, commitment to confidentiality, and ability to deliver consistent results that exceed client expectations.

## Our Humble Beginnings

Ardent's story is one of friendship, vision, and determination. The company began as a small team of 5-10 people, a tight-knit group of friends who decided to take their own path and start their own company. Founded by Iran Salvado and Dominic Narag, the initial team shared not just professional goals but a common vision of creating a workplace that valued both excellent service and employee well-being.

When Ardent first launched, the company had only one client - a testament to the founders' belief in their mission and their confidence in the quality of their work. From a small office with minimal resources, the founding team worked tirelessly to establish a reputation for reliability, accuracy, and professionalism in the legal support industry.

What set Ardent apart from the beginning was the personal relationships between team members. The founders fostered an environment where everyone felt like part of a family rather than just employees. This culture of mutual support and collaboration became the foundation for the company's growth and success.

## Growth and Evolution

From its modest start, Ardent began to expand its client base through word-of-mouth recommendations and the growing reputation for excellence. Each new client brought new challenges and opportunities for the team to develop additional skills and services.

As the workload increased, so did the Ardent family. Careful recruitment ensured that new team members shared the company's values and commitment to quality. Training programs were developed to maintain consistent standards across the growing organization.

The company invested in technology and processes to improve efficiency without sacrificing the personal touch that clients had come to expect. This balance of technological advancement and human expertise has remained a key component of Ardent's approach to service delivery.

## Ardent Today

Today, Ardent Paralegal Business Solutions has grown to over 100 employees, serving multiple clients across various legal specialties. From the original handful of friends to a thriving organization, the company has stayed true to its founding principles while adapting to changing market demands and technological innovations.

Despite its growth, Ardent maintains the close-knit culture established by its founders. Team members continue to support each other professionally and personally, creating a work environment that promotes both individual development and collective success.
